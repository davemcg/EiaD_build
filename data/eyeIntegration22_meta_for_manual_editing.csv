SRS3493356,Eye,Retina,,Adult,Native,,,Adult Tissue,.,Kept,Integrated analysis of genetic variants regulating retinal transcriptome (GREx) identifies genes underlying age-related macular degeneration,,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex multifactorial disease with at least 34 loci contributing to genetic susceptibility. To gain functional understanding of AMD genetics, we generated transcriptional profiles of retina from 453 individuals including both controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD. We integrated retinal transcriptomes, covering 13,662 protein-coding and 1,462 noncoding genes, with genotypes at over 9 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of a tissue not included in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and other large datasets. Cis-eQTL analysis revealed 10,474 genes under genetic regulation, including 4,541 eQTLs detected only in the retina. We then integrated the AMD-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data with eQTLs and ascertained target genes at six loci. Furthermore, using transcriptome wide association analysis (TWAS), we identified 23 additional AMD-associated genes, including RLBP1, HIC1 and PARP12. Our studies expand the genetic landscape of AMD leading to direct targets for biological evaluation and establish the Genotype-Retina Expression (GREx) database as a resource for post-GWAS interpretation of retina-associated traits including glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Overall design: Retinal samples from 523 aged post-mortem human subjects from a spectrum of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were RNA-seq profiled.",SRR7461337,SRP151763,NA,Retina - Adult Tissue MGS 1

Cis-eQTL analysis revealed 10,474 genes under genetic regulation, including 4,541 eQTLs detected only in the retina. We then integrated the AMD-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data with eQTLs and ascertained target genes at six loci. Furthermore, using transcriptome wide association analysis (TWAS), we identified 23 additional AMD-associated genes, including RLBP1, HIC1 and PARP12. Our studies expand the genetic landscape of AMD leading to direct targets for biological evaluation and establish the Genotype-Retina Expression (GREx) database as a resource for post-GWAS interpretation of retina-associated traits including glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.

To gain functional understanding of AMD genetics, we generated transcriptional profiles of retina from 453 individuals including both controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD. We integrated retinal transcriptomes, covering 13,662 protein-coding and 1,462 noncoding genes, with genotypes at over 9 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of a tissue not included in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and other large datasets. Cis-eQTL analysis revealed 10,474 genes under genetic regulation, including 4,541 eQTLs detected only in the retina. We then integrated the AMD-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data with eQTLs and ascertained target genes at six loci. Furthermore, using transcriptome wide association analysis (TWAS), we identified 23 additional AMD-associated genes, including RLBP1, HIC1 and PARP12.

SRS1314620,Eye,RPE,,,Primary culture,,,Cell Line,.,Kept,Restoration of mesenchymal RPE by transcription factor-mediated reprogramming,,"TGFbeta-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major component of the wound healing response and a negative determinant of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) differentiation after periods of sustained sub-confluent culture or repetitive passage. Inhibition of TGFbeta signaling using receptor kinase inhibitors forestalls the onset of passage-dependent EMT and can restore the capacity to differentiate to cells that previously underwent the mesenchymal switch [Radeke et al., 2015, Genome Med. 7:58]. However, even with the sustained inhibition of mesenchymal gene expression using  TGFbeta signaling inhibitors the cells eventually lose the capacity to attain a characteristic phenotype. This suggests that there are additional mechanisms at play that contributeto the prevention of RPE differentiation after protracted periods of wound stimulus and mitosis. In this study we investigate the non-TGFbeta-mediated processes that contribute to the demise of the RPE phenotype after extended periods of proliferative wound response. Using comparative transcriptomics, we show that with increasing passage there is a downregulation of RPE genes, misregulation of cell cycle genes, a decline in proliferative potential that cannot be prevented or reversed by inhibition of TGFbeta signaling using the TGFbeta receptor kinase inhibitor A-83-01. Importantly, among the RPE genes with decreased expression are several transcription factors known to be critical for RPE development. Exogenous expression of MYCN and OTX2 in conjunction with A-83-01 treatment restored the ability of passage 7 RPE  to differentiate. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the loss of capacity to differentiate as a result of chronic wound stimulus is a product of both TGFbeta pathway-dependent increases in mesenchymal gene expression and a TGFbeta pathway-independent loss of RPE programming. Overall design: PolyA+ RNA-Seq analysis of primary fetal RPE donor lines as a function of passage with and without treatment with A-83-01 or after transcription factor-mediated reprogramming were done in triplicate using cells obtained from different donors. PolyA+ RNA-Seq analysis of the adult RPE cell line ARPE-19 was carried out in triplicate using independent experimental replicates obtained on different days.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold the promise of providing an abundant donor source for generating CEC cells for cell replacement therapies. Here we demonstrate that CEC-like cells can be efficiently derived from human ESCs. In addition, we performed global gene expression profiling of stem-cell-derived CEC cells, incorporating with adult CEC cells, fetal CEC cells and other human tissue type data.

Despite the importance of X inactivation, little is known about the 3D configuration of Xi and its relationship to gene silencing. We recently showed that in humans, Xi exhibits two distinctive structural features. First, Xi is partitioned into two huge intervals, called superdomains, such that pairs of loci in each superdomain show an enhanced contact frequency with one another. The boundary between the two superdomains lies near DXZ4, a macrosatellite repeat spanning ~300kb, whose Xi allele extensively binds the protein CTCF. Second, Xi exhibits extremely large loops, up to 77Mb long, called superloops. DXZ4 lies at the anchor of several superloops. Here, we use 3D mapping to study the structure of Xi, focusing on the role of DXZ4. We show that superloops and superdomains are conserved across mammals. We develop a novel variant of our in situ Hi-C protocol, dubbed COLA (COncatemer Ligation Assay) to probe the higher order structures formed by the superloops. In COLA, in situ proximity ligation of multiple extremely short fragments produced by the enzyme CviJI is used to efficiently map simultaneous proximity among three or more loci. Using data from Hi-C and COLA, we demonstrate that DXZ4 and other superloop anchors tend to co-locate simultaneously within the same cells, a result that is confirmed by 3D-FISH. Finally, we examine the effects of deleting DXZ4 from Xi in human cells. Using in situ Hi-C, microscopy, and RNA-FISH, we show that superdomains and superloops disappear; that Xi frequently dissociates into multiple separate structures; and that transcriptional silencing on Xi is compromised. Deletion of DXZ4 from the active X chromosome (Xa) has no such effect. Thus, DXZ4 is essential for proper folding and silencing of Xi. Overall design: Hi-C protocol was used on wildtype and DXZ4-deleted cells to examine the structure of Xi.

Overall design: Cornea endothelial tissue from two patients with PPCD, ages 15 (P5) and 5 (P6), were obtained when the patients underwent a Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (P5) or a penetrating keratoplasty (PK) (P6) . The Descemet membrane and endothelium were placed onto a piece of filter paper and submerged in TRI Reagent (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) for RNA isolation. Human cornea tissue from two age-matched donors, ages 6 and 17, were obtained from commercial eye banks. DescemetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s membrane and corneal endothelium were stripped from the donor corneas using a published technique and placed into TRI Reagent for RNA isolation.     To assess the effect of decreased ZEB1 protein on gene expression in primary human corneal endothelial cells (pHCEnC), confluent pHCEnC cultures were transfected with 10nM anti-ZEB1 siRNA                                                                                                                     (rGrGrCrCrUrArCrArArUrArArCrUrArGrCrArUrUrUrGrUTG) or scrambled siRNA (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) using Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) per the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions.

Methods: Transcriptomic analysis with Illumina HiSeq2000 of fibrovascular membrane and control retina CD31+ samples. The sequence reads were analyzed with ANOVA (ANOVA) and targets with significance (fold change > +/-1.5 and p-value < 0.05) were selected for with Cufflinks, DeSeq2, Partek E/M, and EdgeR. qRTÃ¢â‚¬â€œPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays along with Western blots, siRNA, and MUSE proliferation assays. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped sequence reads per sample to the human genome (hg19) and identified genes that were statistically significant in all four statistical packages. P-values ranged from 8.78E-10 to 0.05. Using this gene list for ontology, highly significant annotation clusters included inflammatory, vascular development, and cell adhesion pathways. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed transcriptomic analysis of CD31+ cells from fibrovascular membrane and CD31+ cells from control retinas with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The preferential selection of inflammatory and angiogenic pathways using this gene list is highly consistent with DR pathogenesis, which involves leaky and aberrant vessel growth.

In this study, we examine the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lincRNA transcriptome using RNA-Seq data generated from human fetal RPE (fRPE), RPE derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-RPE), and undifferentiated iPS (iPS). In addition, we determine the suitability of iPS-RPE, from a transcriptome standpoint, as a model for use in future studies of lincRNA structure and function. A comparison of gene and isoform expression across the whole transcriptome shows only minimal differences between all sample types, though fRPE and iPS-RPE show higher concordance than either shows with iPS. Notably, RPE signature genes show the highest degree of fRPE to iPS-RPE concordance, indicating that iPS-RPE cells provide a suitable model for use in future studies. An analysis of lincRNAs demonstrates high concordance between fRPE and iPS-RPE, but low concordance between either RPE and iPS. While most lincRNAs are expressed at low levels (RPKM < 10), there is a high degree of concordance among replicates within each sample type, suggesting the expression is consistent, even at levels subject to high variability. Finally, we identified and annotated 180 putative novel genes in the fRPE samples, a majority of which are also expressed in the iPS-RPE.

Here, we firstly report a new spontaneously generated RPE line, fhRPE-13A, from a 13-week aborted foetus. We aimed to investigate its availability as a RPE model. Methods:RNA-seq data were mapped to the human genome assembly hg19. Global transcriptional data were analyzed by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed genes(DEGs) to identify gene expression profiles. The morphology and molecular characteristics were examined by immunofluorescence, transmission electron micrographs, PCR and western blot. Photoreceptor outer segments (POS) phagocytosis assay and transepithelial resistance measurement (TER) were performed to assess phagocytic activity and barrier function, respectively. Results: The fhRPE-13A cells showed typical polygonal morphology and the normal biological processes of RPE, had ability of POS phagocytosis in vitro, and expressed TYR and TYRP1 significantly higher than that in ARPE-19 cells.

Furthermore, we realize that stem cell investigations are labor-intensive and require extensive resources. To expedite scientific discovery by sharing of resources and to avoid duplication of efforts, we propose the formation of a Retinal Stem Cell Consortium.

Here, we profiled miRNA expression through small RNA-seq in human ESCs and their RPE derivatives.

We also profiled miRNA expression during intermediate stages of RPE differentiation and identified unique subsets of miRNAs that are gradually up- or downregulated, suggesting dynamic regulation of these miRNAs is associated with the RPE differentiation process. Indeed, the down-regulation of a subset of miRNAs during RPE differentiation is associated with up-regulation of RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, which is exclusively expressed in RPE.

SRS402529,Eye,RPE,,,ESC,H9,,Stem Cell,.,Kept,Comparison of stem-cell derived retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) with human fetal retina pigment epithelium,,"Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) derived from two human embryonic stem cell lines, H1 and H9, were compared with human fetal RPE (hfRPE) using RNA-seq. Nominally, the transcriptome of H1-derived RPE showed greater overlap with hfRPE. For cells maintained in the medium used to differentiate RPE, 6.2% (H1-RPE) and 4.2% (H9-RPE) of the transcripts were expressed in amounts that were statistically different from hfRPE (false discovery rate: 5%).  After adaptation to the serum-free medium, SFM-1, only 1.0 % (H1-RPE) and 1.9% (H9-RPE) were expressed in amounts that were statistically different. For RPE signature genes, statistical differences were observed for 1.0 % (H1-RPE) and 1.9% (H9-RPE) of the transcripts. For some barrier-function related mRNAs the statistical differences were greater than these small differences would predict. For adhesion proteins and plasma membrane transporters, the differences were as great as 6.9% and 4.3%, respectively. After adaptation to SFM-1, the statistical differences between H1- and H9-RPE were only 0.4% for all transcripts, 1.4% for signature genes, and 0.7% for membrane transporters.  No statistical differences were observed for the transcripts related to tight junctions, adhesion junctions or ion channels. In summary, SFM-1 promoted the maturation of stem cell-derived RPE, and the statistical difference between two stem cell lines was minimal. Overall design: RNA sequencing of hfRPE from three fetuses (reference sample) and three independent isolates of RPE derived from the H1, and three from the H9, human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. The cultures were maintained in a serum-free medium, SFM-1.

To obtain global evidence for successful cell fate conversion, we performed gene expression profiling by RNA-seq on CECs, SECs, and LSCs after knocking down PAX6 and on SESCs transduced with PAX6 upon 3-D differentiation. Methods: Under 3-D culture condition, limbal stem cell (LSCs) can be differentiated to Cornea epithelial cells (CECs), and skin epithelial stem cells (SESCs) can be differentiated to skin epithelial cells (SECs). Total RNA was isolated from CECs, SECs, and LSCs after knocking down PAX6 (3-D shPAX6 LSCs) and on SESCs transduced with PAX6 (3-D PAX6+ SESCs) upon 3-D differentiation.

Results: Following optimized decoding and mapping workfollow, we mapped about 5 million sequence reads to the human genome and identified more than 23659 transcripts per sample. Conclusions: Hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially expressed gene signatures revealed that the gene expression pattern of SESCs with PAX6 transduction was strikingly similar to that of CECs, whereas the profile of LSCs with PAX6 knockdown was highly related to that in SECs upon differentiation.

However, a worldwide shortage of donor corneal tissue has led to a search for alternative sources of transplantable tissue. Cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnC) have been shown to restore corneal clarity in experimental models of corneal endothelial dysfunction in animal models, but characterization of cultured HCEnC remains incomplete. To this end, we utilized next-generation RNA sequencing technology to compare the transcriptomic profile of ex vivo human corneal endothelium (evHCEnC) with that of primary HCEnC and HCEnC lines, and to determine the utility of cultured and immortalized corneal endothelial cells as models of in vivo corneal endothelium. Multidimensional analyses of the transcriptome datasets demonstrated that primary HCEnC have a closer relationship to evHCEnC than do immortalized HCEnC. Subsequent analyses showed that the majority of the genes specifically expressed in HCEnC (not expressed in ex vivo corneal epithelium or fibroblasts) demonstrated a marked variability of expression in cultured cells compared with evHCEnC. In addition, genes associated with either corneal endothelial cell function or corneal endothelial dystrophies were investigated. Significant differences in gene expression and protein levels were observed in the cultured cells compared with evHCEnC for each of the genes tested except for AGBL1 and LOXHD1, which were not detected by RNA-seq or qPCR. Our transcriptomic analysis suggests that at a molecular level primary HCEnC most closely resemble evHCEC and thus represent a viable therapeutic option for managing corneal endothelial dysfunction. Our findings also suggest that investigators should perform an assessment of the entire transcriptome of cultured HCEnC prior to determination of the potential clinical utility of the cultured HCEnC for the management of corneal endothelial cell failure. Overall design: Transcriptomes from ex vivo corneal endothelium, primary cultures and three cell lines were compared. Three samples of each endothelial cell group were submitted for RNA sequencing for a total of 15 samples. The transcriptome for the ex vivo corneal endothelium was used as the reference (i.e., proxy for in vivo corneal endothelium).

However, a worldwide shortage of donor corneal tissue has led to a search for alternative sources of transplantable tissue. Cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnC) have been shown to restore corneal clarity in experimental models of corneal endothelial dysfunction in animal models, but characterization of cultured HCEnC remains incomplete. To this end, we utilized next-generation RNA sequencing technology to compare the transcriptomic profile of ex vivo human corneal endothelium (evHCEnC) with that of primary HCEnC and HCEnC lines, and to determine the utility of cultured and immortalized corneal endothelial cells as models of in vivo corneal endothelium. Multidimensional analyses of the transcriptome datasets demonstrated that primary HCEnC have a closer relationship to evHCEnC than do immortalized HCEnC. Subsequent analyses showed that the majority of the genes specifically expressed in HCEnC (not expressed in ex vivo corneal epithelium or fibroblasts) demonstrated a marked variability of expression in cultured cells compared with evHCEnC. In addition, genes associated with either corneal endothelial cell function or corneal endothelial dystrophies were investigated. Significant differences in gene expression and protein levels were observed in the cultured cells compared with evHCEnC for each of the genes tested except for AGBL1 and LOXHD1, which were not detected by RNA-seq or qPCR. Our transcriptomic analysis suggests that at a molecular level primary HCEnC most closely resemble evHCEC and thus represent a viable therapeutic option for managing corneal endothelial dysfunction. Our findings also suggest that investigators should perform an assessment of the entire transcriptome of cultured HCEnC prior to determination of the potential clinical utility of the cultured HCEnC for the management of corneal endothelial cell failure.

Significant differences in gene expression and protein levels were observed in the cultured cells compared with evHCEnC for each of the genes tested except for AGBL1 and LOXHD1, which were not detected by RNA-seq or qPCR. Our transcriptomic analysis suggests that at a molecular level primary HCEnC most closely resemble evHCEC and thus represent a viable therapeutic option for managing corneal endothelial dysfunction. Our findings also suggest that investigators should perform an assessment of the entire transcriptome of cultured HCEnC prior to determination of the potential clinical utility of the cultured HCEnC for the management of corneal endothelial cell failure. Overall design: Transcriptomes from ex vivo corneal endothelium, primary cultures and three cell lines were compared. Three samples of each endothelial cell group were submitted for RNA sequencing for a total of 15 samples. The transcriptome for the ex vivo corneal endothelium was used as the reference (i.e., proxy for in vivo corneal endothelium). Transcript abundances for a subset of genes associated with corneal endothelial cell function or disease were validated with qPCR and western blot. Samples of ex vivo endothelium used for validation were independent replicates not used for RNA-sequencing.",SRR1806590,SRP055101,NA,Cornea - Endothelium

DNA damage-response signaling pathways coordinate these processes, in part, by propagating gene expression-modulating signals. DNA damage does not only influence abundance of mRNAs, but also their coding information through alternative splicing. This level of regulation is thus far poorly understood. Here we show that transcription-blocking DNA lesions promote displacement of activated spliceosomes and initiate a positive feedback loop centered on the DNA damage signaling kinase ATM. Pausing of elongating RNA polymerase at DNA lesions induces spliceosome displacement and R-loop formation. This in turn activates ATM, which signals to further impede splicing activity.

For this purpose, we developed a web-based transcriptome database, which provides a platform-independent, intuitive solution to easily explore and compare ocular gene expression of 100 diseased and healthy human tissue samples from 15 different tissue types collected at the Eye Center of the University of Freiburg. To ensure comparability of expression between different tissues, reads were normalized across all 100 samples. Differentially expressed genes were calculated between each tissue type to determine tissue-specific genes. Unsupervised analysis of all 100 samples revealed an accurate clustering according to different tissue types and a high tissue specificity by analyzing known tissue-specific marker genes. Bioinformatic cell type deconvolution using xCell provided detailed insights into the cellular profiles of each tissue type. Several new tissue-specific marker genes were identified.

To assess the impact of FFPE preparation on MACE, a third part was fixed in formalin and processed for paraffin embedding, and its transcriptional profile was compared with the unfixed specimens analyzed by MACE. To investigate the impact of FFPE storage time on MACE results, 24 FFPE-treated conjunctival samples from 24 patients were analyzed as well. Nineteen thousand six hundred fifty-nine transcribed genes were detected by both MACE and standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, while 3251 and 2213 transcripts were identified explicitly by MACE or RNA-Seq, respectively. Standard RNA-Seq tended to yield longer detected transcripts more often than MACE technology despite normalization, indicating that the MACE technology is less susceptible to a length bias. FFPE processing revealed negligible effects on MACE sequencing results. Several quality-control measurements showed that long-term storage in paraffin did not decrease the diversity of MACE libraries.

Aging interventions based on the application of stem cells to delay cellular senescence have shown good prospects in the treatment of age-related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the potential of the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to reverse the senescence of RPE cells and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated premature and natural passage-mediated replicative senescent RPE cells were directly cocultured with ESCs. The results showed that the proliferative capacity of premature and replicative senescent RPE cells was increased, while the positive rate of senescence-associated galactosidase (SA-β-GAL) staining and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were decreased. The positive regulatory factors of cellular senescence (p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, p16INK4a) were downregulated, while the negative regulatory factors of cellular senescence (Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1) were upregulated. Furthermore, replicative senescent RPE cells entered the S and G2/M phases from the G0/G1 phase.

We further treated ESCs-cocultured premature and replicative senescent RPE cells with SB531542 and LY294002 to inhibit the TGFβ and PI3K pathways, respectively, and found that p53, p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16INK4a were upregulated, while Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, TGFβ, and PI3K pathway-related genes were downregulated, accompanied by decreased proliferation and cell cycle transition and increased positive rates of SA-β-GAL staining and levels of ROS and MMP. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ESCs can effectively reverse the senescence of premature and replicative senescent RPE cells by a direct coculture way, which may be achieved by upregulating the TGFβ and PI3K pathways, respectively, providing a basis for establishing a new therapeutic option for AMD.",SRR12903513,SRP288670,NA,RPE - Cell Line

Aging interventions based on the application of stem cells to delay cellular senescence have shown good prospects in the treatment of age-related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the potential of the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to reverse the senescence of RPE cells and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated premature and natural passage-mediated replicative senescent RPE cells were directly cocultured with ESCs. The results showed that the proliferative capacity of premature and replicative senescent RPE cells was increased, while the positive rate of senescence-associated galactosidase (SA-β-GAL) staining and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were decreased. The positive regulatory factors of cellular senescence (p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, p16INK4a) were downregulated, while the negative regulatory factors of cellular senescence (Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1) were upregulated.

In the present study, we aimed to identify protein markers in AH directly associated with changes in Corneal endothelial cells (CECs), as AH can be easily obtained for analysis. We carried out an in-depth proteomic analysis of patient-derived AH as well as transcriptomic analysis of CECs from the same patients with bullous keratopathy (BK) resulting from CECD. We first determined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from CECs and AH in CECD, respectively. By combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, 13 shared upregulated markers were observed between DEGs and DEPs. Through data integration with individual analysis via data-independent acquisition, three upregulated transcripts and proteins were identified, namely metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), Fc fragment of IgG binding protein (FCGBP), and angiopoietin-related protein 7 (ANGPTL7). Furthermore, we confirmed AH biomarkers for CECD using individual proteome verification and immunoassay validation. Conclusively, our findings may provide valuable insights into the disease process and identify biofluid markers for the assessment of CEC function during BK development.
